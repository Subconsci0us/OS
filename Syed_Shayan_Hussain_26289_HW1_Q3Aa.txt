Pipes offer at least three advantages over temporary files in this scenario. 

First, pipes handle their own cleanup automatically, whereas with file redirection, the shell must manually delete temporary files like /tmp/xyz once the process is complete

Second, pipes can transfer data of any length, while file redirection depends on having sufficient disk space to store all the data. 

Third, pipes enable parallel execution of different stages in a pipeline, whereas the file-based approach requires the first program to fully complete before the second can begin.
